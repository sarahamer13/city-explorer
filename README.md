# City-explorer

**Author**: Sarah Mahdi
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

As a user, you will be able to input a city name and have its exact location, including its location within a country, its latitude and longitude showup. Also, it will show a map that is zoomed in so you can decide where you want to explore. If you input an incorrect city, you will be able to see on the page the error that is displayed.

## Getting Started

- Step 1 - create your react file using the command npx create-react-app 'name of your app'
- Step 2 - create an account on the location IQ site and get a key
- Step 3 - create a .env file with the correct variable name and set it equal to your key, also add the .env to gitignore as it is sensitive information
- Step 4- create the necessary components and use the key HTTP verb "get" in a try-catch statement to retrieve data from the API -Step 5 use the react-bootstrap documentation to bring over the components you require

## Architecture

- I used class based inheritance in REACT, NODE JS, JS, CSS, BOOTSTRAP

- I used the basic form on bootstrap to create the necessary architecture
